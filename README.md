# Rock, Paper, & Scissors Game

A simple game I made to refresh my JS understanding and practice writing code

I made a flowchart/pseudocode at first

But I ended up coding it differently,

![final flow](/flow-charts/final-flow.png)

The style is inspired from fronendmentor.
I coded the JS part probably for 5 hrs and for HTML, CSS 5 hours. I really learned how important it is to understand the problem, even if my final code doesn't match my first flow chart. I tired to code it based on the first flow chart, but I ommitted repeated codes and tried to use one function that will compare the possibilities.
